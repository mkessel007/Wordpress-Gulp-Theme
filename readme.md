### What Is It?
Taskrunner for wordpress development.

### System Requirments

All you need is a [modern browser](http://www.google.com/intl/en_uk/chrome/browser/) a terminal window and [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/) installed..

### How Do I Use It?
Once you have cloned the repositiory you will first need to delete the **.git** file. This file will interfere with your project if you decide to use git so remove it straight after download.

```
$ cd /path/to/your/directory
$ rm -rf .git
```

If you are using git now go ahead and initialise a new repo.

```
$ git init
```

Now thats out of the way down to business. **All** packages needed for the project in its default state are explicitly stated. This means that no fiddling around required to get it to run.

Simply do the following:

```
$ sudo npm install
```

At this point your terminal window will take a few minutes to put everything together. Once its done do the following:

```
$ bower install
```

The same will happen again. Now finally:

```
$ gulp
```

The default gulp task will compile all the template code and start a web server. The server will generate a **random port number**. This number will be 4 digits long and be prefixed with 8. The **full dev url is posted in the terminal window** and just cos its super helpful, it will open up a browser window.

Live reload works out of the box so off you go!

### Support

IMPORTANT! Empty sass files will give the following error
```
gulp(8300,0x7fff7b795300) malloc: *** error for object 0x103b9a5a9: pointer being freed was not allocated
*** set a breakpoint in malloc_error_break to debug
```
If you need to have an empty sass file please add
```
\\
```
inside the file. This will prevent the error. This error is a bug thats on the C layor of the gulp-sass plugin. Devs are aware of it but it has not been fixed yet.
